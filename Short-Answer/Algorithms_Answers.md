#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) as the input increases, the runtime will increase as the same rate as the input because the function is only returning n^2 whereas the base case is set at n^3. With each input increase, the function will have to run the same number of the input. 


b) This problem has nested loops so it will be Polynomial O(n^c). As the input increases, the runtime will increase pretty quickly. It works well for small inputs but it will have poorer performance the larger the input gets. 


c) This problem is recursive and it will be Linear O(n) wherein as the input increases, the runtime increase at the same rate. The algorithm has to perform the function as many times as n increases. It is about the same as a for loop.
